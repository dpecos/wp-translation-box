Description
===========

WordPress plugin that displays a box in the "Add New Post" page that allows you 
to quickly translate any text from and to different languages.

Its purpose is to assist you when you are writing in a different language other 
than your mother tongue and you need to use a translation service as quickly as possible.

This software is opensource, but I do encourage people to donate to help me spend 
time improving existing apps and release new ones. I really appreciate your 
donations and I always send a personal thank you email as soon as the donation 
is received. Thanks again to everyone who has already donated!
